This database system requires the Python module lifelib for a lot of its operations.
This document provides information about how to install it.
--What is lifelib?--
lifelib is a set of tools for manipulation of patterns in cellular automata, which can be used with either C++ or Python.
It can be found here: https://gitlab.com/apgoucher/lifelib

--Installing with pip--
If you have access to pip, installing lifelib is easy.
Open a terminal and run:
pip install python-lifelib

This should install it if your environment supports pip and PATH.

---Windows installation---
If you are using Python on Windows (which is not recommended; to take advantage of git, you should use WSL), Cygwin must be installed as well.
You should do this in Python by importing lifelib and running lifelib.install_cygwin(). The installation should be automatic from there.

--Installing with git--
In some environments, such as WSL, pip might not work correctly. 
You can instead install it with git if your terminal supports it.
Use the following command in this project's repository:
git clone https://gitlab.com/apgoucher/lifelib.git
